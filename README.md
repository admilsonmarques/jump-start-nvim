# Jump Start Nvim with Lazy and Fennel

Small and simple configuration for Neovim, using Lazy as package manager and Fennel as configuration language.

## Comments from an earlier time

During the use of my lazy-nvim configuration I've started having a lot of issues with LSP and Treesitter, the configuration was done after Packer and NullsLSP were maked as archived (or started being intended to be archived), and I was experimenting with a lot of plugins.

So, after watching ThePrimogen video 0 to [LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE), I've decided to create a Jump Start configuration as he demonstrated on his video, adding a few tweeks I've grew fond of.
